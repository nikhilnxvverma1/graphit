# Graph it

An iOS app that allows users to create pie charts on iPhone and view them on companion mac app

### Description
Graph it allows users to create beautiful Pie charts using their iPhones. These Pie charts are pushed into iCloud and viewable through an OSX application. The OSX application fetches iCloud documents upon launch and showcases them along with a legend table at the bottom.

After the pie charts are added through the iPhone app they could be viewed on the mac app.
